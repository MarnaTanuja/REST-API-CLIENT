*Java Weather Report Console Application*

This project is a Java-based Weather Report application built during the CodTech Internship. It demonstrates how to fetch, parse, and display weather data using Java I/O, JSON libraries, and command-line interfaces. Designed to be simple, modular, and extensible, the application showcases how Java can be used to create practical, real-world tools by consuming and processing JSON data — an essential skill in modern software development.

 *Objective*
 
The primary goal of this project is to help beginners understand the fundamentals of integrating external data (in this case, weather reports) into Java applications using JSON parsing and file I/O. By using Java libraries to read structured JSON data and print formatted output, the application introduces concepts like file handling, JSON object traversal, and string formatting.
The project also demonstrates how external libraries (like json-20210307.jar) are integrated into Java projects to support additional functionality such as parsing JSON without requiring manual string operations. This makes it a valuable learning experience for aspiring Java developers aiming to build real-world applications.

 *Project Features*
 
This Weather Report utility includes the following features:

•	 JSON Parsing in Java
The application uses the org.json library (included via json-20210307.jar) to parse weather information stored in a .json or text file format.

•	 File Reading
It reads weather data from a file (e.g., weather.txt) and extracts relevant metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

•	 Formatted Console Output
The application prints the weather data in a well-structured format to the console for easy readability.

•	 Custom City Weather Reports
The user can input different city names (e.g., "paris") to receive formatted weather reports for each location.

•	 Reusable Java Code
The core logic is contained in a simple, clean Java file (ex2.java) with methods separated for readability and maintainability.

•	 Library Integration
The settings.json file ensures external libraries like json-20210307.jar are properly referenced in your Java project, enabling JSON parsing support.

 *File Structure*
 
•	ex2.java: Main Java file that contains the logic to read a JSON object or string from a file and format the weather report.

•	weather.txt: Sample input file simulating a weather API response.

•	json-20210307.jar: External library used for parsing JSON in Java.

•	settings.json: Java project settings file that links required libraries.

 *How to Run*
 
To run this project on your machine:

1.	Clone or download the repository.
   
2.	Import the project into your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
   
3.	Make sure the external library json-20210307.jar is added to your project (as referenced in settings.json).
   
4.	Open and run ex2.java.
   
5.	Follow console prompts or check the formatted weather output.

 *Learning Outcomes*
 
By working on this project, you will:

•	Learn how to integrate and use external libraries in Java.

•	Understand how to read from and write to text files in Java.

•	Get hands-on experience with parsing JSON objects using the org.json package.

•	Format and display structured information through the terminal.

•	Improve your object-oriented programming and error-handling skills.

 *Use Cases*
 
•	 Beginner Java Projects — A great first step into API-like functionality without needing live HTTP calls.

•	 Mock API Simulation — Use local files to simulate real API responses for offline development or testing.

•	 Internship / Academic Submission — Fulfill internship goals with a practical, real-world application.

 *Future Enhancements*
 
•	 Integrate live API support using HttpURLConnection or libraries like OkHttp.

•	 Add multi-city weather support in a loop.

•	 Generate graphical reports using JavaFX or charts.

•	 Export results to external files.

•	 Add AI-powered recommendations based on weather conditions (e.g., "carry an umbrella").

 *Conclusion*
 
This Java Weather Report Application provides a solid introduction to using Java for real-world applications like weather forecasting. By combining file I/O, JSON parsing, and formatted output, the project equips developers with a foundation to build more advanced data-processing tools. Developed as part of the CodTech Internship, it is both a milestone achievement and a stepping stone toward future software engineering projects.
